* CL Web App Configuration
One place to manage configuration. Initially this supports the
following methods of specifying configuration parameters:-

1. Solaris SMF properties
2. Environment variables
3. Manual configuration in CL code

In future it would be good to add, for example, Hashicorp consul as a
configuration source.
